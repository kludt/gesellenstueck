      "stroke.\n",
      "METHODS: From September 2013 to May 2015, consecutive patients with acute stroke \n",
      "were enrolled in this study within 7 days of symptom onset. Clinical information \n",
      "was collected during admission, and stroke severity was assessed at discharge.\n",
      "Depressive symptoms were measured by the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for\n",
      "Depression at 1 month after stroke. Based on the depressive symptoms, diagnoses\n",
      "of depression were made in accordance with DSM-IV criteria. Serum vitamin D\n",
      "levels were measured at admission. Binary logistic regression models were used to\n",
      "determine the association between depression and vitamin D levels treated as\n",
      "either absolute values (categorized as deficiency, insufficiency and sufficiency)\n",
      "or month-specific tertiles. Vitamin D levels were categorized by month-specific\n",
      "tertiles (high, intermediate, low) to reflect seasonal variation of serum vitamin\n",
      "D levels.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 442 patients were enrolled in this study. The prevalence of\n",
      "vitamin D deficiency (< 30ânmol/L) or insufficiency (30-49.99ânmol/L) was 46%.\n",
      "The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was significantly different in winter\n",
      "compared to summer months (p < 0.001). One hundred seven patients (26.6%) were\n",
      "diagnosed with depression at 1 month. In multivariable analyses, after fully\n",
      "adjusting for other potential confounders, the prevalence of depression was\n",
      "significantly higher in patients in the low tertile (odds ratio(OR) 2.24, 95%\n",
      "confidence interval (CI)1.18 to 4.26; p = 0.014) compared to the high tertile,\n",
